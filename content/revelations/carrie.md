I was thirty-three, a single mom of three, and working in the army. I was searching and searching every church along the way. I called the Mormon missionaries after I saw a TV commercial for the church. The missionaries gave me The Book of Mormon which I read front to back and it spoke to my spirit. Then I read ‘A Marvelous Work and Wonder’ which spoke to my intellectual mind. These books together bridged the gap for me; I had finally found my church. My mom came to visit and said, ‘I wish I could be just as happy as you are.’ My life was not easier, by any means, but there was now this peace and I knew everything would be okay.
